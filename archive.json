Intro seems to imply it is the different types of channels. When we started the email thread I thought this was about all non-WG lists and different tooling (chat etc). Scope section seems to say that it is all lists and meetings and chat. But the ombudsteam part is still clearly not in it.\r\n\r\nI think there's some room for discussion here perhaps on what we are actually proposing. Are WGs in it or not? And WG meetings? I'm fine whatever the answer is but we should be clear about it. (I do think though that tracking all WG lists may be a large task for a single moderation team.)\r\n\r\nI think the introduction should clearly lay out what the unification is, e.g., \r\n\r\nOLD:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.\r\nNEW:\r\nThis document proposes the creation of a moderator team for all of the IETF's various contribution channels.

In the past, there have been very strong disagreements about moderation, and questioning of legitimacy of particular actions within the IETF process. Allowing the moderators to 'define [...] their role' and 'adopt moderation criteria' outside of the IETF consensus process opens up a number of questions about how that works, whether the output is legitimate in the eyes of the community, etc. \r\n\r\n> Maybe I'm missing it, but it's not clear to me what the *powers*\r\n> of moderators are.

So I think it is necessary -- IME it's much more effective if bad behaviour is caught and stopped early.\r\n\r\nTo that question of whether WG chairs should still be able to moderate -- I'm not sure, but I observe very different behaviour in different WGs. What passes in some WGs as normal debate would be flagged by chairs as disruptive. Will moderators appreciate these differences, or set a new level for some WGs? And what will that level be?\r\n\r\nWhether or not WG chairs still have the ability to moderate, it'd be good to understand what the expected interactions between chairs and moderators would be. E.g., will moderators check in with chairs on a proposed resolution, to get context and assure that it will work in that community? If chairs retain the ability to moderate, do they need to inform moderators when they act? Etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, an editorial nit: I found Section very difficult to read, in part due to the liberal sprinkling of references throughout the text. It might help to move references to the end of the applicable sentence, where possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n```",

This draft has a more minimal policy (no escalation steps), and something like this will have to match the writing style in this document.\n\n**Additional context**\nI would expect the moderators to go with \"I'm holding your messages for the chair to review\" if there's something borderline.

Let's combine them into a single section (presumably 2).  Section 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 are about process.  They should be combined into a single section (presumably 2bis/3).  This leaves Section 2.4.  It can reside either in the Section 2 or remain on its own.\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nOptional: A clear and concise description of any alternatives you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n",

Formally on behalf of the LLC given that this intersects with the LLC role in a number of places\n> \n> - no concerns with Section 2.1 and the exclusion of staff/contractors from being moderators\n> \n> - no concerns with Section 2.2 Training and the implied financial commitment as this is reasonably handled/\n> \n> - a concern with Section 3 Roles and Responsibilities and the specification that Moderators are responsible for \"attendee lists\".  There are at least three of these for different sets of attendees (all, new participants, companions) and they are considered an integral part of the meeting experience and therefore currently moderated by the meetings team.  Also, these lists are opt-in and anyone who chooses not to participate is not disadvantaged when it comes to the standards process, which to my mind differentiates them from plenary fora.  So I would prefer that removed.\n> \n> - no concerns with Section 3.2 but a note that if this text was not present then there would be a concern: \"Content removal or redaction from IETF archives are not moderation actions, and are therefore also beyond the scope of this memo.\"\n> \n> - no concerns with Section 5.2 \"Relation to the IETF LLC\" as this is language we proposed \n> \n> \n> 2.  Informally and noting up front that my suggestions below specifically should not be included in assessing the last call, I have the following feedback:\n> \n> i) In the Introduction: \"It creates a moderator team to draft procedures\" \u2014> \"It creates a moderator team to define procedures\" as 'draft' implies producing something for someone else to approve and \"define\" is used later in Section 4 where this is elaborated upon though Section 2 uses \"develop\".\n> \n> ii) In 1.2 General Philosophy \"The cornerstone of our philosophy is first and foremost the individual, whose responsibility is to further the goals of the organization\" \u2014> \"The cornerstone of our philosophy is that individuals are responsible for furthering the goals of the organization\" because a) both \"cornerstone\" and \"first and foremost\" is excessive; and b)  it\u2019s hard to read as is.\n> \n> iii) Section 3 \"For a Working Group, the chairs should perform moderation in a way that obviates the need for moderator team involvement.\" seems a bit too much to ask (is moderator action then a grounds to remove chairs?), perhaps \"should aim to perform\"\n> \n> iv) Section 4 \"comity\" - not only is that an exceptionally unusual word even for native English speakers and therefore making this unnecessarily hard to understand, it is effectively setting a new policy as regards the intent of moderation.\n\n",

I don't know how much clearer it could be.\n\n[Out of Scope: Non-IETF Fora, Private Communications, and Content Removal](https://larseggert.github.io/draft-ietf-modpod-group-processes/draft-ietf-modpod-group-processes.html#name-out-of-scope-non-ietf-fora-)\nIt is important to note that the moderator team only moderates public IETF fora.

It is a word with a definition of: \"posing a problem.\" There is a sense of the word related to \"political correctness\", but that's not what is meant here. It's obviously not about efforts like \"hemispheric sensitivity\" (where you take care to note that it is winter in Australia in August, and that it is 6:30pm in Dublin when it is 10:30am in SF). That stuff is exhausting, but there is a more straightforward definition, and it is sense number 1.\n\n> > \n> > * abstract: \"grace\" - I'll take it when I see it, but I doubt\n> >   that \"will treat people... with... grace\" will often approximate\n> >   truth - I'd suggest removing that.

It is to get someone on board without requiring them to read the document. Also, I would find it embarrassing if we couldn't write \"The IETF community will treat people with kindness and grace, but not endless patience.\" Here, we want so many senses of this word: elegance, goodwill, brevity, reprieve, etc.",

We already mention fairness specifically in the principles;\n2. The paragraph in question doesn't seem the correct place to try to reiterate one of or all of those principles;\n3. I'm not really sure how to address the threat beyond the five safeguards that already exist.\n4. I'm not sure what reference to add, even if I could find the right place.\n\nIf we are talking about a person from company X abusing their power against company Y, that is possible all over the place in the IETF, and I would argue it has in fact happened on occasion, and not just at the IETF. At least at the IETF it typically surfaces because everyone ends up yelling at the AD.  You may not have experienced this in the security area, but go ask the int and routing ADs.

I do have one other\nissue to raise, that I'll do in a separate email as it's\nmaybe more controversial and less related to the text of\ndraft-10.\n\nCheers,\nS.\n\nNon-nits:\n\n- section 4: \"Any attempt to circumvent or otherwise ignore a moderation\naction is a demonstration of bad faith that may warrant further\nmoderation.\" - I think this is just wrong, one cannot know for sure\nsuch action is a demonstration of bad faith - it could be ignorance,\nor cultural. I think we want to say that decision makers can factor\nwhat they perceive as such efforts into future/additional decisions\nbut we don't need to say more.\n\n- 4.2: \"Requests for reinstatement may be made only a year after the\ninitial decision, and then only annually afterwards\" - anyone can\nask, any time, I think we want to say that decision makers can choose\nto take no action for a year after a decision, rather than say that\nsuch a request can't be made. Maybe also s/year/4 months/ as I\ndon't see why a year is a good choice and 3 times a year matches\nthe IETF cadence for various things and should be long enough for\nan otherwise reasonable person to have re-discovered \"comity\":-)\n\n- 5.2: The LLC frequently delete errata spam. Do we need to say\nanything related to that? I think the answer is \"no\" but forget\nif that was discussed. If we did want to say something it might\nbe along the lines of \"the LLC may operate policies they define\nfor handling spam in fora related to the IETF that are subject\nto injection of spam (e.g. current errata processing)\" but might\nbe better to say nothing as hopefully errata processing will be\nimproved soonish.\n\nNits:\n\n- section 4: \"comity\" - not a good word choice, as noted already:-)\n\n- 4.1: The appeals text is written as if this document is what sets\nour the moderation procedures, rather than this document tasking a\nteam to develop such procedures. The text is probably ok though but\nmaybe the editors might want to look at it another time in that light.\n\n- 4.2: \"grace\": more flowery language\n\n\nAlso:\n\nHiya,\n\nI do not think this WG or this draft is imposing a censorship\nregime. However, I do think that is a risk that we ought to\naddress.\n\nI suggest we add an Appendix D that says that, e.g. along the\nlines of:\n\n\"\nAppendix D: Risks related to better IETF community moderation\n\nThere is a risk that the evolution of well-intended procedures\nestablished following this document gives rise to a regime\nwhere participants are censored, or feel that they are subject\nto an unreasonable censorship regime, or where participants\nself-censor in fear of being considered disruptive.

An example of such a list is `iesg@ietf.org`. In the previous PR-action process, the clause `maintainers of any IETF mailing list may, at their discretion, also remove posting rights to that IETF mailing list` would allow the maintainers of that list to also ban the target of the PR-action. In the new world, what happens? If someone on the moderator team happens to be on the non-public list, are they allowed to ban that person? If none of the moderators are on a non-public list, is there a process by which the maintainers of that list can ban someone?",

In addition, as I think was\n> pointed out a few weeks ago, it is quite likely that the final\n> version of the document will be read by those who have an interest in\n> finding flaws and ambiguities, so it is probably more important to\n> get the text just right than would be the case with, e.g., a protocol\n> spec.  \n> \n> I'm not addressing more general, strategic, and controversial issues\n> because, whether I agree or not, the direction of the WG seems clear\n> and, hence that those topics should probably wait for IETF LC and/or\n> a discussion at IETF 124.\n> \n> \n> (1) Last paragraph of the introduction to Section 1 (i.e., before\n> Section 1.1):\n> \n> Given the rest of the paragraph, the newly added last sentence should\n> probably read:\n> \n> \t\"These changes take effect for the IETF when the procedures\n> \tdescribed in Section 4 have been approved by the IESG.\"\n> \n> Or the paragraph should be restructured so that the current first\n> sentence is replaced by something like:\n> \n> \t\"The processes described in this document are solely\n> \tapplicable to IETF activities and take effect when the\n> \tprocedures described in Section 4 have been approved by the\n> \tIESG.  They do not apply to other related ...\"\n> \n> and the new sentence dropped.\n> \n> (2) The new sentence of the second bullet of Section 3 is a\n> considerable improvement.  However, it is another example of the\n> failure to distinguish between actions by the moderator team and\n> those of individual moderators.  As it is now written, the\n> relationship between Administrators and actions taken by individual\n> moderators is unclear.  Suggested improvement:\n> \n> \t\"Administrators may amend or rescind actions, including those\n> \ttaken by the moderation team or individual moderators *after*\n> \tthey have consulted with that team.\"\n> \n> In other words, if an Administrator disagrees with actions taken by\n> an individual moderator, the first step is to bring the action to the\n> attention of the team and then initiate a discussion/ consultation.\n> \n> (3) In 3.1, the new sentence might be improved by explicitly allowing\n> \"the administrators of such list\" to consult the moderation team for\n> advice, rather than just adopting \"some of the processes\".  If they\n> cannot consult (or even involve) the moderator team, it is not\n> entirely clear what such adoption would mean since they have always\n> had the ability to advise participants on their behavior or apply\n> restrictions and this document does not change that.\n> \n> (4) The first paragraph of Section 4:\n> \n> \t\"Within the bounds of the policies set herein, and with the\n> \tapproval of the IESG, the moderator team shall develop and\n> \tmaintain processes...\"\n> \n> can be read as requiring that the IESG approve the moderator team's\n> plan for developing and maintaining processes and not the resulting\n> processes themselves.  For those of us concerned about community\n> review of (and possibly even rough consensus on) the processes, not\n> clearly requiring that the IESG sign off on the processes /\n> procedures is even more problematic.   It also seems to put this\n> section in conflict with the provision of Section 1 (see (1) above)\n> which does specify a requirement for IESG approval of procedures.\n> \n> (5) Also on that subject, the document sometimes uses \"procedures\",\n> sometimes \"processes\", and sometimes \"guidelines\".  It is not clear\n> whether they are intended to be read as synonyms.    And then various\n> sentences in Section 4 read as if \"processes\" and \"criteria\" are\n> different, but the differences are not really clear. \"Policy\" may be\n> part of the confusion as well, but I didn't find places where it\n> seemed problematic. Especially at this late date, this might be\n> grounds for a sentence (probably a new, second, paragraph) in Section\n> 1.1 rather than expecting the Editors to tighten the terminology that\n> is scattered through the document.\n> \n> (6) In the third paragraph of section 4, the newly moved sentence(s), \n> \n> \t\"Those who are directed to stop disrupting a forum must do so\n> \timmediately.\"\n> \n> would probably better be\n> \n> \t\"Those who are directed to stop disrupting a forum are\n> \texpected to do so immediately.\"\n> \n> because the \"must\" is clearly not actionable except, more or less, by\n> the next sentence.  If that sentence was intended even partially as a\n> threat, it might be better to replace the two sentences by something\n> more like:\n> \n> \t\"Those who are directed to stop disrupting a forum are\n> \texpected to do so immediately. Failure to do so is likely to\n> \tlead to further corrective actions.\"\n> \n> or one could say \"will normally\" rather than \"is likely to\"\n> \n> \n> (7) The sixth paragraph of Section 4 (\"All moderation actions...\")\n> would be easier to follow if it were rearranged to be more like:\n> \n> \t\"All moderation actions that restrict participation\n> \tprivileges shall be immediately reported to those against\n> \twhom those actions take effect and to the moderator team for\n> \ttheir review.  They shall also be periodically reported to\n> \tthe IESG.\"\n> \n> (8) Since I'm quibbling, in the last sentence of 4.1, the antecedent\n> of \"that person\" is not clear.  The sentence can easily be read as\n> referring to the Area Director.  In addition, I don't know whether it\n> needs to be spelled out, but I assume that an AD can also decide that\n> the nature of a particular action or its cause would benefit from\n> drawing in the whole IESG (or even specific other ADs) rather than\n> being forced to make a decision and then hope \"that person\" will\n> appeal.\n> \n> (9) The addition of crossreferences to the bullet list in Section 6\n> is, IMO, a huge improvement.

See also (11) below.\n> \n> (9b) In bullet (4), I cannot find a requirement to inform the\n> community about long suspensions in Section 4 unless more than one\n> forum is involved.   I'm not confident I know what the WG intended.\n> If it was to notify only the forum if the action is restricted to it,\n> then bullet (4) should be tweaked to say something closer to \"the\n> relevant forum, or when multiple fora are involved, the community\".\n> If the intent was to notify the community about all longer\n> suspensions, then Section 4 needs adjustment.\n> \n> (9c) Something of the same problem applies to bullet (6).  While one\n> can possibly read it into \"and maintain\" in the first sentence of\n> Section 4, I don't see either a requirement for periodic review or\n> some decision process about problems that would trigger such a\n> review.  \n> \n> (10) In Appendix B.2, \"not been able to agree on a common definition\n> of disruptive behavior\" appears in both bullet 2 and bullet 4.  I\n> don't know if it is worth fixing, but it feels cumbersome.  \n> \n> (11) Finally and at the risk of saying something substantive that I\n> don't recall being brought up in the context of this document, for\n> many years observations have been common in the IETF to the effect\n> that every WG (or at least every Area) is different.

Nothing I can find in the\n> body of the document, with the possible exception of the first bullet\n> of Section 1.2, appears to support that sort of consistency or the\n> need for it.  \"Widest possible freedom of action\" in Section 4 seems\n> to tend in the other direction.

Otherwise, if that is the\n> intent, maybe it should be said more explicitly in the body of the\n> text.  And the IESG should be prepared for appeals based on \"I\n> behaved in exactly the same way in WG X as in WG Y, and it was ok in\n> WG X but, in WG Y, the chair took me aside and threatened me, so the\n> WG Y chair should be fired\".

I raised this point to Eliot a few days ago, and he agreed that it might be too much of an idiom. \r\n\r\nI also said I didn't like \"comity\". It is exactly the right word, but I thought it was a bit obscure and difficult to translate. That one I can live with, but I still think we should go for more plainspoken English in this document, since we need everyone to understand it. Should we say \"fora\", or just grit our teeth and write \"forums\"? Should the reader need to understand Latin pluralization in the midst of English? That kind of thing. Maybe just opt out and say \"venues\".",

              "body": "Overall I agree with the general mindset and decision-making here. However, when it gets down to implementation, I think the details leave an unspecified window that is open to interpretation.\r\n\r\nLet's take a hypothetical scenario:\r\n* Alice is a long-time contributor of the FOO WG\r\n* Alice sends an email to the FOO WG mailing list that the moderators find to be inappropriate\r\n* A moderator replies that this was inappropriate and asks Alice to do better\r\n* Alice digs their heels in, and repeats the offensive behavior\r\n* [time T0] The moderator reaches out privately to the chairs saying that they want to block Alice's email to the FOO WG list for 2 weeks\r\n* The FOO WG chair says that the moderator is overreacting and shouldn't take such a drastic measure because Alice is an important contributor and the topic at hand is a WGLC that will expire before those 2 weeks\r\n* The moderator and FOO WG chair talk but are unable to come to agreement\r\n* This gets escalated to the responsible AD for FOO, who decides to side with the moderator\r\n* [time T1] the moderator goes into the admin interface and puts Alice in moderation\r\n\r\nIn this example, the time delay between T0 and T1 could be multiple days. That's too much time as it could allow the list discussion to spiral out of control. So \"something\" needs to happen between T0 and T1, even if \"something\" is \"let Alice keep posting\" - in this context, inaction is still an action. So my question is: can we clarify what happens between T0 and T1 in this scenario? Options include:\r\n* Alice's posting rights are maintained\r\n* Alice's emails are moderated by the moderator\r\n* Alice's emails are moderated by the WG chair\r\n* Alice's emails are blocked\r\n* Both the moderator and chair have access to the admin interface so they play admin tennis constantly undoing the other's action to get the list in the state they want it to be in\r\n* We take the entire Internet offline and all go touch grass\r\n\r\nAnother way to phrase this whole thing could be to say that the moderator is allowed to put the block in place, but must immediately notify the chairs. If the chairs disagree, they can follow the usual appeals process, but aren't allowed to undo the moderator's action themselves until either they come to an agreement with the moderator, or the appeal is adjudicated.\r\n\r\n",

You don't need context there. :)\r\n\r\nI always try to suggest text, since one thing people often say is \"why not open a PR?\" when someone is just arguing. But that doesn't mean I am being insistent.\r\n\r\nEdit: I might also add that the README says \"Contributions can be made by creating pull requests.\" (subject to the usual Note Well material). Here, you have a well-written opener. I think anyone would perk up at that opening sentence vs \"This document describes the creation of a moderation team...\". I think you are missing that the first task is to get people to read the document in the first place.  Now, do you want to let Rob write that? Different question, but I'm OK with it if you write a better first sentence . \r\n\r\nThe trick here is this: you write one sentence about good things like empathy, honesty, and kindness. Then you flip to the \"This document describes...\" stuff with no verbal transition. It makes the procedural text much more powerful. If you look at my PR here, just imagine a \"\ud83d\udc40\" in the break after the first sentence. I don't care if you use my exact words.",

With this in mind, moderators are expected to identify when someone\r\nhas crossed a line, and what action is appropriate.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis probably addresses another point that @becarpenter made elsewhere as well.",

Engaged, respectful\u00a0discussion within the scope of a forum is not considered abuse, nor should someone be considered abusive solely because they are outside the rough consensus. Disagreement and diverse points of view within any standards organization are to be expected and are even healthy. \u00a0With that in mind, moderators are expected to identify when someone has crossed a line, and what action is appropriate. When someone crosses the line into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken to maintain the decorum of the community.\r\n\r\nModeration will be consistent and fair to encourage participation. Disagreements may be appealed, and decisions can be\r\nreconsidered over time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is explicitly **not** punishment, but maintaining an open, welcoming, non-hostile environment where all may participate on equal footing, regardless of their position or their past contributions.\"",

It might be that your opinions are not too interesting.\r\n\r\nThat is different from creating a new email account and abusing the IETF's infrastructure with your new account that no one reads other than on IETF lists.\r\n\r\nSo, is it the sort of \"free speech\" which will drive people away? Is it an \"unpopular opinion\", maybe only stated once? Pretty much the point of my input: the IETF can say \"cool it\" for a short period of time with no public record. Everyone has gotten worked up in an argument a few times. My draft is way better at describing this part, tbh, but \"circumvention\" is too vague in this diff.\r\n\r\nBut in the interest of \"rough consensus,\" it is fine. It will come up again, though.",

I've heard both sentiments. So, if there's resistance to change, it comes from people who think the status quo is OK. I do not think it is OK, but I am willing to listen.",

While considering what to write here, I realised that it would be good to give moderators discretion to take a light-touch approach in borderline cases. For example if a particular post is in the grey area between civil and uncivil, it may be useful to place the sender in hold for moderation for a few days so that if a subsequent message crosses the line, it can be prevented from reaching the list.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is that we require moderators to always notify the affected person about holds. If we take this route, moderators are likely to refrain from taking action in borderline cases, and wait until the line has been crossed. In this scenario some damage (e.g. to newcomer participation) is incurred.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate WG thoughts on this wording.",

If the ombudsteam is *confidentially* notified about some behavior that doesn't rise to the level of harassment, the ombudsteam can encourage the reporter to notify the chair/administrator, or the mod team in the alternative. If the reporter asks an ombudsperson to help out (maybe the reporter feels uncomfortable making the report), and the ombudsperson also believes that the behavior is disruptive, the ombudsperson can make a report to the chair/administrator/mod-team, but that's as an individual. The ombudsteam should not get into the business of being a conduit for reports that should have gone to the chair/administrator/mod-team in the first place, both because it will sound like it's coming from some level of authority (which the PR text seems to imply) and because it will end up with far too many reports to the ombudsteam.\r\n\r\nAside from that, the charter is quite clear: \"The revising or redefining of related Ombudsteam policies or practices such as [RFC7776](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7776/) [...] is out of scope.\" And the document even says quite clearly: \"Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role of the ombudsteam.\"\r\n\r\nLet's not do this.",

If the IESG deems that [three is the right number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk), then that's OK. But if we al think that five is the right number, but two moderators resign and the IESG is too busy to find two new people to appoint, then we have an understaffed team. A potential solution to this is to add something like \"`The IESG is allowed to change the size of the moderator team by issuing an IESG statement.`\" but at that point it might be process overkill. We could also just remove any discussion of a specific number and just say something like \"`If there are too many resignations from the moderator team to the point that it no longer operates well, the IESG will rapidly appoint new moderators to\r\nbring the size back up.`\"",

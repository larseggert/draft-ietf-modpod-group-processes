# Introduction

This memo describes the moderation of disruptive participation
across the IETF's various public contribution channels and discussion fora.
It creates a
moderator team to develop procedures and to facilitate their consistent
application.

This memo makes the following changes:

- Obsoletes {{!RFC3683}} as the "posting rights" (PR) action it defines
  are replaced by procedures defined herein;
- Obsoletes{{!RFC3934}} as it replaces working group moderation
  procedures;
- Obsoletes {{Section 3 of !RFC9245}} and the second paragraph of
  {{Section 4 of !RFC9245}}, as the moderator team replaces the
  IETF discussion list moderation team.
- Updates {{Section 6.1 of !RFC2418}}, because the moderator team will
  now work together with working group chairs to moderate disruptive
  behavior.

The details of each of these changes and the philosophy behind them
are described below.

## Background {#background}

The IETF community has defined general guidelines for
personal interactions in the IETF {{?RFC7154}}, and the IESG has
defined an anti-harassment policy for the IETF {{AHP}} for which the IETF
community has defined anti-harassment procedures {{!RFC7776}},
empowering an ombudsteam {{OT}} to take necessary action.

Dealing with *disruptive* behavior, however, is not part of the role
of the ombudsteam. {{?RFC2418}} tasks the chairs of each IETF working
group with moderating their group's in-person meetings while
{{!RFC3934}} provided chairs a procedure to help manage mailing
lists. An IESG statement {{MODML}} described additional guidance
to working group chairs about how — but not when — to moderate their
lists.

For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
IESG statement {{DP}} clarifies that the IESG tasks list administrators
with moderation. And the IETF list for general discussions
has, mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not
list administrators and operate by a different set of processes
{{?RFC9245}}.

Note that the term "moderation" can refer both to *preemptive*
moderation, where moderators review attempted participation before it occurs
(such as reviewing messages to a mailing list), and *reactive* moderation,
where moderators intervene after problematic participation has occurred. The
IETF historically mainly practiced reactive moderation, with a spectrum from
gentle reminders on- and off-list, all the way to suspension of posting rights
and other ways of participating or communicating. It is up to the moderators
to decide which mix of preemptive and reactive moderation to employ as
part of their processes.

In addition, {{?RFC3683}} defines a process for revoking an
individual's posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a
community last-call of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed
by the IESG, often in response to complaints from the community.

Experience and community input suggests that an evolution of the
existing processes is necessary (see {{motive}}).

## General Philosophy {#genphil}

The cornerstone of our philosophy is first and foremost the individual, whose
responsibility is to further the goals of the IETF as an organization {{!RFC3935}}
in a manner consistent with the policy laid out in {{!RFC7154}}.

The IETF is an open standards organization.  Engaged, respectful
discussion that is within the scope of a forum should not be considered disruptive,
nor should someone be considered disruptive solely because they are outside the rough
consensus.

Disagreement and diverse points of view within any standards organization
are to be expected, and are even healthy. However, when someone crosses the line
into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken in order to maintain
decorum of the community.

The moderation policy goals are as follows:

- Apply consistent, fair, and timely moderation of communication across all public
  IETF participation channels and participation fora;
  without regard to one's position or previous contributions;
- Appeals are available to address disagreements about moderation actions;
- Balance transparency against both privacy of individuals involved and further
  disruption to the community;
- Allow moderation decisions to be reconsidered; and
- Provide the broadest possible latitude to all people doing moderation, so
  that they have the flexibility to address a broad range of individuals
  and circumstances.

Questions about processes detailed below should be answered through the lens
of these aims.

The goal is explicitly **not** punishment, but to maintain an open, welcoming,
non-hostile environment in which all may participate on an equal footing,
regardless of their position or past contributions.

## Terminology

Below we use the term "administrator" to refer to the people who
are assigned by the IESG to manage a particular public participation
channel or discussion forum. This document uses the term "forum"
to refer to any public IETF participation channel, such as a mailing list,
chat group, or discussion in a collaborative tool such as GitHub or
GitLab. For example, working
group chairs are administrators of all the public fora their WG
uses, which typically includes mailing lists and chat groups, but might
also include collaborative tools such as GitHub or GitLab. Another example
of administrators are the "owners" of non-WG IETF mailing lists.

# IETF Moderator Team

This memo proposes a uniform approach to moderating the
IETF's various public fora. A moderator team for the IETF
will develop uniform guidelines for moderation and will facilitate
their implementation and application as detailed below.
These changes are intended to address the issues identified
in the previous model {{motive}} and the principles described in the
introduction.

## Composition

The moderator team consists of no less than five
individuals.  The IESG appoints and replaces moderators.
In selecting members, the IESG will take into
account geographic coverage, expected and unexpected absences, and
team diversity.

The moderator team may expand or contract
based on operational experience.  Apart from appointing and replacing
moderators, the IESG shall refrain from the day-to-day operation
and management of the moderator team. The moderators may
consult with the IESG when needed.

Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
decisions (see {{appeals}}), the IESG must not appoint a
moderator who is serving on the IESG or IAB. Individuals serving on
other bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF
Trust or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors shall
also be excluded from serving on the moderator team. If a moderator
is assuming any such role, they shall step down from the moderator team
soon after.

### Team Diversity

Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
should reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
throughout the year. Ideally, the moderators should be able to
respond to issues within a few hours.

Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
problematic behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
contacting.

## Training

The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
appointed moderators as necessary. The IESG will negotiate any
required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC
{{?RFC8711}}.

# Scope and Responsibilities

This policy applies to all public IETF fora, both present and
future, including, but not limited to, mailing lists, chat groups,
and discussions in other systems that the IETF or WGs have chosen to
employ, such as GitHub repositories, Wikis, or issue trackers.

Different people have different responsibilities.

**Participants** should always behave in a manner discussed in
{{genphil}}.  They are also encouraged to report inappropriate behavior
directed at them or someone else to an administrator of the respective
forum **and** the moderators.

**Administrators** are primarily responsible for managing their fora in
accordance with guidance developed by the moderators and approved by
the IESG. As such, they shall address reports of inappropriate behavior
in a timely fashion, apprising moderators of their disposition. For a
Working Group, the chairs should perform moderation in a way that
obviates the need for moderator team involvement.

**Moderators** are responsible for establishing processes to
address moderation needs across all IETF fora, both present and
future.  They are a resource that the community
can use to address problematic contributions.

Moderators may take actions when administrators do not respond to
reports in a timely fashion.  Their first action should generally be
to attempt to contact and advise the relevant administrators.
They should only take
moderation actions when administrators are not responsive.  In
particular, moderators should generally give WG chairs
the opportunity to
manage what may be difficult and contentious debates within their
groups.  Within the bounds of this principle, it is left to
moderators' judgement to determine when they must act, with the
understanding that some situations may require fast responses.
{{appeals}} discusses the handling of disagreements.

Moderators are administrators for IETF
plenary fora, currently including the IETF discussion and last-call lists, attendee
lists, and any plenary chat sessions. They are also administrators for
any forum that cuts across IETF areas or does not have an
administrator.

In order to scale the function, except for plenary fora as described
above, moderators are not expected to always actively monitor
all communications.  Instead, they will process reports from
participants.

**Area Directors** are expected to resolve conflicts as described here and
in {{appeals}}.  The IESG is responsible for appointing and overseeing
the moderator team, and approving guidance provided by that team.

## Out of Scope: Non-IETF Fora, Private Communications, and Content Removal

It is important to note that the moderator team only
moderates *public* IETF fora. Their mandate does
not extend to problematic behavior in private communication, such as
private chat groups, direct messages, or conversations or other
interactions outside of meetings. In such cases, the Ombudsteam
should be approached.

Content removal or redaction from IETF archives are not moderation
actions, and are therefore also beyond the scope of this memo.

# Moderation Procedures and Transparency {#prod}

Within the bounds of the policies set herein, and with the
approval of the IESG, the moderator team shall develop
processes and criteria relating to moderation, including
the moderator team's own operating procedures.

Those processes and criteria shall be developed with community input
and made public, but need not be documented in the RFC series.  This
shall be the first task for the moderator team.  Until
that happens, the previous procedures remain in effect.

The intent of this memo is to provide the widest possible freedom of
action to administrators and moderators, with a few constraints.
Examples of actions that could be taken include:

- Automated rate limiting mechanisms;
- Review and approval of submissions/messages;
- A private or public admonishment;
- Temporary or permanent bans in one or more fora.

We stress that these are only examples, and not in any way
prescriptive. Administrators and moderators are free to decide on
these or other actions.

The expectation is that the minimal actions necessary will be taken.

Any attempt to circumvent or otherwise ignore a moderation action
is a demonstration of bad faith that may warrant further moderation.

The moderator team is responsible to the IESG.  The IESG
may create or designate a forum to facilitate discussion about
moderation, and refer interested parties to that forum.

All moderation actions that restrict posting rights shall be
periodically reported to the IESG,
as well as immediately to those against whom those actions take effect.

To address inappropriate contributions in a timely manner, only
moderation actions suspending participation rights for longer than
fourteen (14) days shall be reported to the forum to which such an action applies.
If such an action applies to more than one forum, it should be communicated to
the community in a manner decided by the IESG.

## Consistency and Conflict Resolution {#appeals}

Administrators and moderators shall act in a manner
consistent with guidelines approved by the IESG.  In cases of
disagreement between the administrators and the moderator team
over a moderation decision, the matter should be taken up
with the responsible area director for resolution, or the IETF chair
if a responsible area director cannot be determined or is not assigned.

Because the moderator team serves at the discretion of the IESG,
any moderation decision can be appealed to the IESG by anyone,
per {{!RFC2026}}. Disagreements with a decision by the moderator team can
be brought to their attention. If this does not lead to a resolution, a
decision by the IESG can be appealed to the IAB as described in
{{!RFC2026}}.

## Reinstatement

People and circumstances change.  Individuals whose participation
rights have been suspended from a forum may request
reinstatement.
Requests for reinstatement
may be made only a year after the initial decision, and then
only annually afterwards.

Any such request must be
directed to the entity who made the decision (e.g., moderator team,
working group chairs, etc.) or their successors.  That party may at
their discretion
reinstate someone, conditionally or unconditionally.

To avoid
denial-of-service attacks on our processes, decisions to not reinstate
someone's participation rights may not be appealed.
Any reinstatement is a grace and not a right.

A ban imposed prior to this process shall be reconsidered only in
accordance with the processes in place at the time of the ban,
even if the corresponding RFC has been formally obsoleted.

# Relationship to other IETF functions

## Relation to the Ombudsteam

Administrators and moderators shall complement the efforts of the IETF
ombudsteam {{OT}}, whose focus on anti-harassment and operation
shall remain unchanged. Administrators and moderators should always
report suspected harassment.  They should nonetheless take any
necessary actions regarding disruptive behavior.

## Relation to the IETF LLC

The Board of Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has
fiduciary duty for the overall organization, which includes the duty
to protect the organization from serious legal risk that may arise
from the behavior of IETF participants.

This protection may include the need for the IETF LLC to take
emergency moderation actions. These emergency actions are expected to
be taken only when the IETF LLC has received legal advice that such
action is necessary, and therefore extremely rare in frequency. Some
examples of where this might be necessary are:

- Someone making a credible threat of harm to other IETF participants.
- Someone using IETF mailing lists and/or websites to share content
  where publishing that content on IETF lists and/or websites brings
  serious legal risk.
- Someone making a credible threat of legal action where any form of
  interaction with them on IETF mailing lists may have serious legal
  consequences for the IETF.

If any such action is taken, the IETF LLC should, except where
limited by legal advice to the contrary, inform the IESG as soon as
possible, providing full details of the subject of the action, nature
of the action, reason for the action and expected duration. The IETF
LLC should also inform the moderator team and IETF community, except
where it receives legal advice to the contrary.

As such an action would be taken by the IETF LLC in order to protect
the IETF according to its fiduciary duty, then it cannot allow that
to be overridden by a decision of the moderator team or the IESG.
The subject of any such action may request a review by the IETF LLC
board, as documented in section 4.7 of {{!RFC8711}}

Any such action taken by the IETF LLC under this section of this
policy, is not subject to the rest of this policy.

## Relation to the IRTF

The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) {{?RFC2014}} is a peer
organization separate from the IETF that is governed by its own
set or rules and processes. {{Sections 3, 6 and 7 of
?RFC9775}} discuss rules for participating
in the IRTF and moderation of IRTF participation fora.

# Security Considerations

The usual security considerations {{?RFC3552}} do not apply to this
document.

Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
process, per {{appeals}}.

Moderation actions are intended to limit the likelihood
of disruptive behavior by a few IETF participants from discouraging
participation by other IETF participants.

# IANA Considerations

No IANA actions are requested.

# Problems with the Previous Approach {#motive}

The previous approach to moderation of disruptive participation
through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
ideal:

- The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common definition
  of disruptive behavior. Therefore, chairs and list administrators
  apply individually different criteria when making decisions, and
  participants have different expectations for when PR-actions are
  warranted.

- The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
  follow {{?RFC3934}} is slow and cumbersome, which makes it
  ill-suited to situations that escalate quickly. It also assumes
  that the originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided
  participant who can be reasoned with and who will change their
  ways.

- Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions for
  their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of disruptive
  behavior spans multiple lists. Also, chairs and list administrators
  may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that spans multiple
  lists, due to not being subscribed to some of them.

- PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
  lists, are cumbersome and slow, and the community has not been able
  to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior. This has
  led to a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when they
  are used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

- For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
  reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator, for
  various reasons. For mailing lists not associated with working
  groups, list administrators are not even publicly identified - they
  can only be contacted through an anonymous alias address. This
  exacerbates the problem, because participants may not be
  comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous party.

- The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
  and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
  which moderation processes are currently defined. IETF business
  also happens in chat groups, remote meeting participation
  systems, virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.
  How disruptive behavior is moderated in these fora is currently
  undefined.

# Non-Normative Examples of Disruptive Behavior {#examples}

The list below describes some types of disruptive behavior, but it
is non-exhaustive.

- Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
  activities, or technical concerns;

- Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject;

- Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
  sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF;

- Repeatedly arguing counter to a WG charter that has been approved by
  the IESG; and

- "Sealioning", where a participant makes incessant requests for evidence or
  data, even while remaining superficially polite.

These items are examples. Moderators and administrators may take moderation
actions for many other cases.

The moderator team's task consists of
subjective judgement calls. Behaviors not listed here might require
moderation, and it is not possible to write a complete list of all such
behaviors.

Unsolicited bulk e-mail is considered disruptive, and thus within the moderation
scope, but actions taken against it are not considered moderation actions
and don't trigger a requirement for reporting the action to the originator
or to the IESG.

                draft-ietf-modpod-group-processes-latest

Abstract

   The IETF community will treat people with kindness and grace, but not
   endless patience.

   This memo establishes a policy for the moderation of disruptive
   participation across the IETF's various public contribution channels
   and discussion fora.  It establishes guardrails for moderation and a
   moderator team.  That team will develop a set of guidelines and
   facilitate their consistent implementation with chairs and
   administrators.

1.  Introduction

   This memo establishes a policy for the moderation of disruptive
   participation across the IETF's various public contribution channels
   and discussion fora.  It creates a moderator team to develop
   procedures and to facilitate their consistent application.

   This memo obsoletes and updates some prior IETF processes, summarized
   here.  Background information is described in more detail in
   Appendix B.

   This memo makes the following changes to existing processes:

   *  Obsoletes [RFC3683] as the "posting rights" (PR) action it defines
      are replaced by procedures defined herein;

   *  Obsoletes [RFC3934] as it replaces working group moderation
      procedures;

   *  Obsoletes Section 3 of [RFC9245] and the second paragraph of
      Section 4 of [RFC9245], as the moderator team replaces the IETF
      discussion list moderation team.

   *  Updates Section 6.1 of [RFC2418], because the moderator team will
      now work together with working group chairs to moderate disruptive
      behavior.

   The processes described in this document are solely applicable to
   IETF activities, and not to other related organizations, such as the
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the Internet Architecture Board
   (IAB), the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), the RFC Series Approval
   Board (RSAB), or the Independent RFC Submission Stream, without their
   explicit agreement.  These changes take effect when the procedures
   described in Section 4 have been approved by the IESG.

1.1.  Terminology Note

   Below we use the term "administrator" to refer to the people who are
   assigned by the IESG to manage a particular public participation
   channel or discussion forum.  This document uses the term "forum" to
   refer to any public IETF participation channel, such as a mailing
   list, chat group, or discussion in a collaborative tool such as
   GitHub or GitLab.  For example, working group chairs are
   administrators of all the public fora their WG uses, which typically
   includes mailing lists and chat groups, but might also include
   collaborative tools such as GitHub or GitLab.  Another example of
   administrators are the "owners" of non-WG IETF mailing lists.

1.2.  General Philosophy

   The cornerstone of our philosophy is that individuals are responsible
   for furthering the goals of the IETF as an organization [RFC3935] in
   a manner consistent with the policy laid out in [RFC7154].

   Disagreement and diverse points of view within any standards
   organization are to be expected, and are even healthy.  The IETF is
   an open standards organization with a discussion-based rough
   consensus process, a non-normative description of which is in
   [RFC7282].  Engaged, respectful discussion that is within the scope
   of an IETF forum should therefore not be considered disruptive, nor
   should someone be considered disruptive solely because they are
   outside the rough consensus.  However, when someone crosses the line
   into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken in order to
   maintain decorum of the community.

   The moderation policy goals are as follows:

   *  Apply consistent, fair, and timely moderation of communication
      across all public IETF participation channels and participation
      fora without regard to a participant's role in the IETF or
      previous technical contributions;

   *  Appeals are available to address disagreements about moderation
      actions;

   *  Balance transparency against both privacy of individuals involved
      and further disruption to the community;

   *  Allow moderation decisions to be reconsidered; and

   *  Provide the broadest possible latitude to all people doing
      moderation, so that they have the flexibility to address a broad
      range of individuals and circumstances.

   Questions about processes detailed below should be answered through
   the lens of these aims.

   The goal is explicitly *not* punishment, but to maintain an open,
   welcoming, non-hostile environment in which all may participate on an
   equal footing, regardless of their role in the IETF or past technical
   contributions.

2.  IETF Moderator Team

   This memo proposes a consistent approach to moderating the IETF's
   various public fora.  A moderator team for the IETF will develop
   guidelines for moderation and will facilitate their consistent
   implementation and application as detailed below.  These changes are
   intended to address the issues identified in the previous model
   Appendix B.2 and the principles described in the introduction.

2.1.  Composition

   The IESG appoints and recalls moderators.  The moderator team
   initially consists of no less than five individuals.  The moderator
   team may expand or contract based on operational experience.  In
   selecting members, the IESG will take into account geographic
   coverage, expected and unexpected absences, and team diversity.

   Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
   decisions (see Section 4.1), the IESG must not appoint a moderator
   who is serving on the IESG or IAB.  Individuals serving on other
   bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF Trust
   or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors shall also be
   excluded from serving on the moderator team.  If a moderator is
   assuming any such role, they shall step down from the moderator team
   soon after.

2.1.1.  Team Diversity

   Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
   should reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
   characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
   throughout the year.  Ideally, the moderators should be able to
   respond to issues within a few hours.

   Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
   disruptive behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
   contacting.

2.2.  Training

   The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
   administrators and moderators as necessary.  The IESG will negotiate
   any required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC
   [RFC8711].

3.  Scope and Responsibilities

   This policy applies to all public IETF fora, both present and future,
   including, but not limited to, mailing lists, chat groups, and
   discussions in other systems that the IETF or WGs have chosen to
   employ, such as GitHub repositories, wikis, or issue trackers.

   Different people have different moderation responsibilities:

   *  *Participants* should always behave in a manner discussed in
      Section 1.2.  They are also encouraged to report disruptive
      behavior directed at them or someone else to an administrator of
      the respective forum *and* the moderators.

   *  *Administrators* are primarily responsible for managing their fora
      in accordance with guidance developed by the moderators and
      approved by the IESG.  As such, they shall address reports of
      disruptive behavior in a timely fashion, apprising moderators of
      reports or actions taken.  Administrators may amend or rescind
      actions, including those taken by the moderation team *after* they
      have consulted with that team.

      For a working group, chairs are by default the administrators.
      They may delegate this responsibility, but they must always
      accept, acknowledge, and keep track of complaints of disruptive
      behavior.  Forum administrators should perform moderation in a way
      that obviates the need for moderator team involvement.

   *  *Moderators* are responsible for establishing processes to address
      moderation needs across all IETF fora, both present and future.
      They are a resource that the community can use to address
      disruptive behavior.  The moderator team is responsible to the
      IESG.  The IESG may create or designate a forum to facilitate
      discussion about moderation, and refer interested parties to that
      forum.

      Moderators may take actions when administrators do not respond to
      reports in a timely fashion.  Their first action should generally
      be to attempt to contact and advise the relevant administrators.
      They should only take moderation actions when administrators are
      not responsive, or when someone disrupts multiple fora at the same
      time.  Moderators should generally give WG chairs the opportunity
      to manage what may be difficult and contentious debates within
      their groups.  Within the bounds of this principle, it is left to
      moderators' judgement to determine when they must act, with the
      understanding that some situations may require fast responses.
      Section 4.1 discusses the handling of disagreements.

      Moderators are administrators for IETF plenary fora, currently
      including the IETF discussion and last-call lists and any plenary
      chat sessions.  They are also administrators for any forum that
      does not otherwise have an administrator.

      In order to scale the function, except for plenary fora as
      described above, moderators are not expected to always actively
      monitor all communications.  In general, they will process reports
      from participants.

   *  *Area Directors* are expected to resolve conflicts as described
      here and in Section 4.1.  The IESG will periodically evaluate the
      performance and needs of moderators, and may appoint and recall
      moderators as they deem appropriate.  Apart from that, the IESG
      shall refrain from the day-to-day operation and management of the
      moderator team.  The moderators may consult with the IESG when
      needed.

3.1.  Actions That Are Out of Scope

   Moderator actions are only permitted for the purposes of limiting
   disruptive communications in IETF fora.  All other actions are beyond
   the scope of this memo.  Examples of actions that are out of scope
   include, but are not limited to, datatracker account removal,
   restriction of in-person meeting registration, content removal or
   redaction, and moderation or policing of private or non-IETF
   communications.  While the moderator team does not moderate non-
   public IETF mailing lists, the administrators of such lists can
   choose to adopt some of the processes that the moderator team
   develops.

3.2.  Unsolicted Bulk Messages

   Unsolicited bulk messages are considered disruptive and should be
   handled in a manner consistent with the IESG statement on IETF Spam
   Control on IETF Mailing Lists[IESG-SPAM], or its successors.
   Administrators and moderators may take similar actions in other fora
   (e.g., GitHub or Instant Messaging).  Such actions require no
   additional reporting.

4.  Moderation Procedures and Transparency

   Within the bounds of the policies set herein, and with the approval
   of the IESG, the moderator team shall develop and maintain processes
   and criteria relating to moderation, including the moderator team's
   own operating procedures.

   Those processes and criteria shall be developed with community input
   and made public, but need not be documented in the RFC series.  This
   shall be the first task for the moderator team.  Until those
   processes and criteria are established, all previous procedures
   referenced in Section 1 shall remain in effect.

   The intent of this memo is to provide the widest possible freedom of
   action to administrators and moderators, with the expectation that
   the minimal actions necessary will be taken.  Those who are directed
   to stop disrupting a forum must do so immediately.  Further
   disruptions may lead to further corrective actions.

   Examples of actions that could be taken include:

   *  Automated rate limiting mechanisms;

   *  Review and approval of submissions/messages;

   *  A private or public admonishment;

   *  Temporary or permanent suspension of participation privileges in
      one or more fora.

   We stress that these are only examples, and not in any way
   prescriptive.  Administrators and moderators are free to decide on
   these or other actions.

   All moderation actions that restrict participation privileges shall
   be periodically reported to the IESG, as well as immediately to the
   moderator team for their review, and immediately to those against
   whom those actions take effect.

   Only moderation actions suspending participation privileges for
   longer than fourteen (14) days must be reported to the forum to which
   such an action applies, or in any event, at the request of the
   suspended person.  If such an action applies to more than one forum,
   it should be communicated to the community in a manner decided by the
   IESG.

   Moderators will periodically provide an aggregate report to the
   community on actions taken under this policy.

4.1.  Consistency and Conflict Resolution

   Administrators and moderators shall act in a manner consistent with
   this memo and the guidelines approved by the IESG.  In cases of
   disagreement over a moderation decision, anyone may take the matter
   up with the responsible Area Director for resolution, or with the
   IETF chair if a responsible Area Director cannot be determined or is
   not assigned.  If the disagreement cannot be resolved by the Area
   Director, that person may then appeal to the IESG, and subsequently
   to the IAB using the processes stated in Sections 6.5.1 and 6.5.4 of
   [RFC2026].

4.2.  Reinstatement

   People and circumstances change.  Individuals whose participation
   privileges have been indefinitely suspended from a forum may request
   reinstatement.  Requests for reinstatement may be made only a year
   after the initial decision, and then only annually afterwards.

   Any such request must be directed to the entity who made the decision
   (e.g., moderator team, working group chairs, etc.) or their
   successors.  That party may at their discretion reinstate someone,
   conditionally or unconditionally.

   To avoid denial-of-service attacks on our processes, decisions to not
   reinstate someone's participation privileges may not be appealed.
   Any reinstatement is a grace and not a right.

   A suspension of participation privileges imposed prior to this
   process shall be reconsidered only in accordance with the processes
   in place at the time of the suspension, even if the corresponding RFC
   has been formally obsoleted.

5.  Relationship to other IETF functions

5.1.  Relation to the Ombudsteam

   Administrators and moderators shall complement the efforts of the
   IETF ombudsteam [OT], whose focus on anti-harassment and operation
   shall remain unchanged.  Administrators and moderators should always
   report suspected harassment.  They should nonetheless take any
   necessary actions regarding disruptive behavior.

5.2.  Relation to the IETF LLC

   The Board of Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has
   fiduciary duty for the overall organization, which includes the duty
   to protect the organization from serious legal risk that may arise
   from the behavior of IETF participants.

   This protection may include the need for the IETF LLC to take
   emergency moderation actions.  These emergency actions are expected
   to be taken only when the IETF LLC has received legal advice that
   such action is necessary, and therefore extremely rare in frequency.
   Some examples of where this might be necessary are:

   *  Someone making a credible threat of harm to other IETF
      participants.

   *  Someone using IETF mailing lists and/or websites to share content
      where publishing that content on IETF lists and/or websites brings
      serious legal risk to the IETF.

   *  Someone making a credible threat of legal action where any form of
      interaction with them on IETF mailing lists may have serious legal
      consequences for the IETF.

   If any such action is taken, the IETF LLC should, except where
   limited by legal advice to the contrary, inform the IESG as soon as
   possible, providing full details of the subject of the action, nature
   of the action, reason for the action and expected duration.  The IETF
   LLC should also inform the moderator team and IETF community, except
   where it receives legal advice to the contrary.

   As such an action would be taken by the IETF LLC in order to protect
   the IETF according to its fiduciary duty, then it cannot allow that
   to be overridden by a decision of the moderator team or the IESG.
   The subject of any such action may request a review by the IETF LLC
   board, as documented in section 4.7 of [RFC8711]

   Any such action taken by the IETF LLC under this section of this
   policy, is not subject to the rest of this policy.

5.3.  Relation to the IRTF

   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [RFC2014] is a peer
   organization separate from the IETF that is governed by its own set
   of rules and processes.  Sections 3, 6 and 7 of [RFC9775] discuss
   rules for participating in the IRTF and moderation of IRTF
   participation fora.  The policies described in this memo do not apply
   to the IRTF.

6.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   There is the potential abuse of the moderation process by moderators,
   working group chairs, and potentially others that could lead to
   censorship of legitimate participation.  This potential risk is
   mitigated in eight ways:

   1.  Section 4 requires the moderator team to first establish
       processes and procedures that are intended to apply uniformly
       across the IETF.

   2.  Section 1.2 explicitly states that viewpoints outside of the
       rough consensus are not in and of themselves disruptive.

   3.  Section 4 provides transparency by requiring that moderation
       actions that restrict participation privileges be immediately
       reported to the affected person and to the moderation team, and
       periodically reported to the IESG.

   4.  That same section requires that the community be informed in the
       case of suspensions lasting longer than 14 days.

   5.  Section 4.1 lays out an appeals process in the case of
       disagreements.

   6.  If moderators find that the procedures themselves are leading to
       inappropriate moderation, Section 4 allows them to update those
       procedures in consultation with the community, and with the
       approval of the IESG.

   7.  If IETF participants believe that either the IESG or the IAB are
       not performing their respective oversight functions as described
       in this document, they may comment to the NOMCOM [BCP10] or the
       community at large.

   8.  Finally, if it appears that these processes are not functioning
       properly, the policies stated in this memo may be amended.  They
       are not set in stone.

   Moderation actions are intended to limit the likelihood of disruptive
   behavior by a few IETF participants from discouraging participation
   by other IETF participants.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are requested.

Appendix B.  Motivation

   Section 1 summarized the process changes introduced by this memo.
   This appendix discusses the background that led to them.

B.1.  Background

   The IETF community has defined general guidelines for personal
   interactions in the IETF [RFC7154], and the IESG has defined an anti-
   harassment policy for the IETF [AHP] for which the IETF community has
   defined anti-harassment procedures [RFC7776], empowering an
   ombudsteam [OT] to take necessary action.

   Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role
   of the ombudsteam.  [RFC2418] tasks the chairs of each IETF working
   group with moderating their group's in-person meetings while
   [RFC3934] provided chairs a procedure to help manage mailing lists.
   An IESG statement [MODML] described additional guidance to working
   group chairs about how — but not when — to moderate their lists.

   For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
   IESG statement [DP] clarifies that the IESG tasks list administrators
   with moderation.  And the IETF list for general discussions has,
   mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not list
   administrators and operate by a different set of processes [RFC9245].

   Note that the term "moderation" can refer both to _preemptive_
   moderation, where administrators review attempted participation
   before it occurs (such as reviewing messages to a mailing list), and
   _reactive_ moderation, where administrators intervene after
   disruptive participation has occurred.  The IETF historically mainly
   practiced reactive moderation, with a spectrum from gentle reminders
   on- and off-list, all the way to suspension of posting rights and
   other ways of participating or communicating.  It is up to the
   moderators and administrators to decide which mix of preemptive and
   reactive moderation to employ as part of their processes.

   In addition, [RFC3683] defines a process for revoking an individual's
   posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a community last-call
   of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed by the IESG, often
   in response to complaints from the community.

   Experience and community input suggests that an evolution of the
   existing processes is necessary.

B.2.  Problems with the Previous Approach

   The previous approach to moderation of disruptive participation
   through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
   with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
   ideal:

   *  The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common
      definition of disruptive behavior.  Therefore, chairs and list
      administrators apply individually different criteria when making
      decisions, and participants have different expectations for when
      PR-actions are warranted.

   *  The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
      follow [RFC3934] is slow and cumbersome, which makes it ill-suited
      to situations that escalate quickly.  It also assumes that the
      originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided participant who
      can be reasoned with and who will change their ways.

   *  Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions
      for their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of
      disruptive behavior spans multiple lists.  Also, chairs and list
      administrators may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that
      spans multiple lists, due to not being subscribed to some of them.

   *  PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
      lists, are cumbersome and slow, and the community has not been
      able to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior.  This
      has led to a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when
      they are used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

   *  For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
      reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator,
      for various reasons.  For mailing lists not associated with
      working groups, list administrators are not even publicly
      identified - they can only be contacted through an anonymous alias
      address.  This exacerbates the problem, because participants may
      not be comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous
      party.

   *  The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
      and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
      which moderation processes are currently defined.  IETF business
      also happens in chat groups, remote meeting participation systems,
      virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.  How
      disruptive behavior is moderated in these fora is currently
      undefined.

Appendix C.  Non-Normative Examples of Disruptive Behavior

   The list below describes some types of disruptive behavior, but it is
   non-exhaustive.

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to a forum's charter or scope;

   *  Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject;

   *  Messages announcing conferences, events, or activities that are
      not sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF, unless
      posted with prior approval of list administrators;

   *  Repeatedly arguing counter to a WG charter that has been approved
      by the IESG; and

   *  "Sealioning", where a participant makes incessant requests for
      evidence or data, even while remaining superficially polite.

   These items are examples.  Moderators and administrators may take
   moderation actions for many other cases.

   The moderator team's task consists of subjective judgement calls.
   Behaviors not listed here might require moderation, and it is not
   possible to write a complete list of all such behaviors.
